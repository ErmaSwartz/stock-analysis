# stock-analysis
## Overview of the Project 
### This project was focused on examining different stocks in the years 2017 and 2018. The aim was to discover which stocks performed well in those years. The goal was to use data to be able to make better more informed choices about the stock market. The reason to dive into this data and learn how to understand it is because making data driven investments gives us a better chance of seeing good returns on those investments. Our project uncovered which companies had better outcomes based on their volume and returns during the given years. 

## Results of our Analysis 2017
### Let's first look at the year 2017. Out of our 12 stocks, only TERP had a negative return. That said, there was a lot of deviation in the returns we saw. Of all the stocks with positive returns, RUN only ecperienced 5% growth in 2017. In contrast, DQ grew by 199.4% in 2017. Take a look at the chart bellow for more details. ![image](https://github.com/ErmaSwartz/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2017.png) If we examine our data we discover that there are four stocks who grew by more than 100% in 2017. This is an incredible return on investments in one year, so it might be a safe bet to invest in these companies. That said, we can't be sure that one good year means that a stock will continue to grow at that rate, it could indicate that that stock is more volatile or sensative to market trends. We need to look at 2018 to have a better idea of where to invest. 

## Results of our Analysis 2018 
### In 2018 we found that the same stock, TERP had negative growth again. We can be sure that is not where we want to invest our money. Generally in 2018 our stocks showed lower returns overall. As we see in this graph ![image](https://github.com/ErmaSwartz/stock-analysis/blob/main/returns_2018_not_refactored.png) some of the stocks that experienced very good returns in 2017, actually experienced shrinkage in 2018. For example, DQ which was the stock with the greatest percentage of growth the previous year, experienced a pretty drastic loss of 63% in 2018. This stock is probably too volatile and we may not want to invest there.  ENPH on the other hand experienced 130% growth in 2017 and 82% growth in 2018. My recommendation would be to invest in that stock, as it experienced pretty high returns both years. That said, more data from more years would help us make an even more informed choice. 

## Refactoring Code
### When we originally wrote the code to do this analysis, the time it took to perform the analysis was significantly longer than when we refactored the code. For example, for the year 2017 the code took 1.5 seconds to perform the analysis. ![image](https://github.com/ErmaSwartz/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_Before_Refactoring.png). After we refactored the code however it took .20 seconds, a significantly shorter amount of time. ![image](https://github.com/ErmaSwartz/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2017.png). 

## Summary 
### Refactoring code has several advantages. It makes the analysis run faster, and it also helps to make your code more concise and clear. That said, the disadvantage of doing so is that it takes the programmer more time to go back and work on the code to make it more efficient. While there is time lost on behalf of the programmer, the fact that the program runs so much more efficiently makes it significant and important to do so. Making code clearer and easy to understand, while also making it so that the client has a faster answer to his analysis questions is worth the extra work. In this case, refactoring the code made the results come in significantly faster and made the interface of how to get the results easier to understand for someone who perhaps would not know VBA. I therefore think it was worth it.
